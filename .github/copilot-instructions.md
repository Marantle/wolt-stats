# Best Practices for Writing a Static AstroJS Project with React and Tailwind CSS

AstroJS, combined with React and Tailwind CSS, provides a powerful stack for building performant and scalable static websites. Follow these best practices to ensure your Astro projects remain maintainable, performant, and easy to extend.

## Project Structure

Maintain a clear and intuitive folder structure:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── UI/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── sections/
├── pages/
├── styles/
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   └── fonts/
├── lib/
└── utils/
```

## Typescript type correctness
- always after making changes to a file, make sure it poses no typescript errors

## Astro Components

### Component Architecture
- Keep Astro components small, focused, and reusable.
- Avoid too much logic directly within Astro files; delegate complex interactions to React components.

### Props and Slots
- Clearly define props with TypeScript interfaces for clarity and maintainability.
- Use Astro slots effectively to compose layouts and components dynamically.

### Using React Components in Astro
- Limit React usage to components requiring interactivity.
- Use the `client:load`, `client:idle`, or `client:visible` directives wisely to control when JavaScript loads.

Example:
```astro
---
import InteractiveComponent from '../components/InteractiveComponent.jsx';
---

<InteractiveComponent client:visible />
```

## Tailwind CSS Integration

### Setup and Configuration
- Keep your Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.mjs`) clear and structured.
- Use custom themes and plugins to enhance and reuse Tailwind utilities effectively.
- Tailwind config is now from 2025, #fetch https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/astro so the existing vite tailwind config is correct

### Styling Best Practices
- Favor Tailwind's utility classes over custom CSS.
- Extract repetitive styles into reusable Tailwind components or plugins.

Example configuration:
```javascript
export default {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{astro,js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#1E40AF',
        secondary: '#64748B',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

## Performance Optimization

### Astro-Specific Optimizations
- Leverage Astro's partial hydration to minimize JavaScript load.
- Utilize Astro's built-in support for image optimization with `astro:assets`.

### React Component Optimization
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders using hooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback`.
- Consider using lightweight alternatives to heavy libraries.

## SEO and Accessibility

### SEO Best Practices
- Ensure Astro components leverage built-in features to generate optimized meta tags.
- Create a dedicated SEO component for consistent SEO handling across pages.

### Accessibility
- Always use semantic HTML elements.
- Regularly check accessibility compliance using tools like Lighthouse or axe.

Example SEO component:
```astro
---
const { title, description } = Astro.props;
---

<head>
  <title>{title}</title>
  <meta name="description" content={description} />
</head>
```

## Testing and Deployment

### Unit Testing
- Use **Vitest** for a fast, reliable testing experience compatible with Vite.
- Utilize mocking libraries such as `@testing-library/react` and `msw` (Mock Service Worker) for mocking APIs and components.
- Aim for high coverage with tools like **Istanbul** to identify untested areas.
- Keep unit tests granular, fast, and deterministic.

Example Vitest configuration (`vite.config.ts`):
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    coverage: {
      provider: 'istanbul',
    },
  },
});
```

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright
- Write e2e tests for critical user flows using **Playwright**.
- Keep tests isolated and independent to avoid flakiness.
- Regularly run tests in various browsers to ensure compatibility and robustness.
- Integrate e2e testing into your CI/CD pipeline.

Example Playwright test:
```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('homepage loads correctly', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Home | Example/);
});
```

### Deployment
- Deploy your static site using services optimized for static hosting, such as Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.
- Utilize CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment workflows.

Example deployment pipeline (`astro.config.mjs`):
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://example.com',
  integrations: [],
  output: 'static',
});
```

By following these best practices, you'll ensure your AstroJS project remains performant, scalable, and easy to maintain.
