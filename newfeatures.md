## Technical Requirements

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Use web workers for heavy calculations
   - Optimize chart rendering with lazy loading

2. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add keyboard navigation for all features
   - Implement screen reader optimizations
   - Support high contrast mode
   - Add ARIA labels and roles

3. **Local Storage Management**
   - Implement data compression for local storage
   - Add storage quota management
   - Provide storage cleanup utilities

4. **PWA Features**

   - Implement app manifest
   - Add install prompts
   - Enable background sync

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Add detailed error messages
   - Implement error boundary components
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Implementation Notes

- All features must maintain the current privacy-first approach
- No external API calls or data storage outside the browser
- Use existing tech stack (Astro, React, TailwindCSS)
- Maintain current performance standards
- All new features must have corresponding unit and e2e tests

## Migration Plan

1. Phase 1: Core Feature Enhancements (NFR001-NFR004)
2. Phase 2: UI/UX Improvements (NFR005-NFR007)
3. Phase 3: Advanced Features (NFR008-NFR010)

Each phase should include:
- Feature implementation
- Test coverage
- Documentation updates
- Performance benchmarking

<!-- Data Analysis: Added deeper insights with cuisine categorization, price tracking, and pattern detection
Customization: Introduced dashboard customization and enhanced privacy controls
Offline Capabilities: Proposed PWA features for better offline experience
Export Options: Added various export formats while keeping everything local
Technical Improvements: Included performance optimizations and accessibility enhancements -->
